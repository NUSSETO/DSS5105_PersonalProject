# DSS5105_PersonalProject
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices in Singapore using LightGBM regression model.

## Project Components

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing : Handling formatting inconsistencies, numeric extraction, and missing values.
- Feature Engineering : Creating area-per-unit metrics, temporal variables, and location-based attributes.
- Model Development : Building and refining a LightGBM regression model with iterative feature adjustments.
- Model Evaluation : Assessing performance using RMSE, cross-validation, and feature importance.
- Analytical Insights : Identifying trends and patterns across multiple dimensions based on model outputs.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, lightgbm, scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
  
## Notes

- This project demonstrates my end-to-end machine learning workflow for structured tabular data.
- All work is reproducible through the included notebook and can be extended for future experimentation.
